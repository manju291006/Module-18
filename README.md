## Representation of Graph â€“ Write a Python program to generate a graph for a given fixed degree sequence

###  Aim
To Write a Python program to generate a graph for a given fixed degree sequence


###  Algorithm

Start the program.

Input the fixed degree sequence from the user.

Import the required libraries (networkx and matplotlib).

Create a graph using the degree sequence.

Check if the degree sequence is valid using the Havel-Hakimi algorithm.

Generate the graph using nx.havel_hakimi_graph().

Draw the graph using matplotlib.

Display the graph.

End the program.

### ðŸ§¾ Program
```
# Python3 program to generate a graph
# for a given fixed degrees

# A function to print the adjacency matrix.
def printMat(degseq, n):
	
	# n is number of vertices
	mat = [[0] * n for i in range(n)]

	for i in range(n):
		for j in range(i + 1, n):

			# For each pair of vertex decrement
			# the degree of both vertex.
			if (degseq[i] > 0 and degseq[j] > 0):
				degseq[i] -= 1
				degseq[j] -= 1
				mat[i][j] = 1
				mat[j][i] = 1

	# Print the result in specified form
	print("      ", end ="")
	for i in range(n):
		print(" ", "(", i, ")", end ="")
	print()
	print()
	for i in range(n):
		print("  ", "(", i, ")", end = " ")
		for j in range(n):
			print("  ", mat[i][j], end = " ")
		print()

# Driver Code
degseq=[]
for i in range(0, 5):
    ele = int(input())
  
    degseq.append(ele)
#degseq =[v0,v1,v2,v3,v4]

n = len(degseq)
printMat(degseq, n)

## Breadth First Search â€“ Write a Python  program to print BFS traversal from a given source vertex. 



###  Aim
To Write a Python  program to print BFS traversal from a given source vertex. 



###  Algorithm

Start the program.

Input the number of vertices and edges of the graph.

Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.

Input the edges between vertices.

Input the source vertex.

Initialize a queue and a visited list to track visited vertices.

Enqueue the source vertex and mark it as visited.

Repeat until the queue is empty:

Dequeue a vertex and print it.

Enqueue all its unvisited adjacent vertices and mark them as visited.

End the program.

## Topological Sort â€“ Write a Python  program to print topological sorting of a DAG



###  Aim
To Write a Python  program to print topological sorting of a DAG



###  Algorithm

Start

Input the directed acyclic graph (DAG).

Create a visited list (all vertices marked as not visited).

Initialize an empty stack.

For each vertex in the graph:

If the vertex is not visited:

Perform DFS from that vertex:

Mark the vertex as visited

Visit all unvisited adjacent vertices recursively

After visiting all neighbors, push the vertex onto the stack

Pop all vertices from the stack one by one to get the topological order.

End
